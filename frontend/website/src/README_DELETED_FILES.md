# Deleted Student Portal Files

The following files have been removed as the Student Portal has been eliminated from the REACH application:

## Main Student App
- `/components/StudentApp.tsx` - Main student application component

## Student Components Directory
- `/components/student/StudentDashboard.tsx` - Student dashboard interface
- `/components/student/StudentProfilePage.tsx` - Student profile management  
- `/components/student/StudentPronunciationPage.tsx` - Student pronunciation practice interface

## Unused Parent Components
- `/components/parent/EnhancedPronunciationPage.tsx` - Alternative pronunciation interface (replaced by PronunciationPortalV4 with integrated assignments)

## Reasoning
The Student Portal has been completely removed from the application architecture. All student-related functionality is now handled through:

1. **Parent Portal** - Where parents help students with pronunciation practice and assignments
2. **Staff Portal** - Where REACH staff manage student accounts and assignments  
3. **Teacher Portal** - Where teachers create and assign vocabulary tasks

This architectural change simplifies the user experience by consolidating student interactions within the parent supervision model, which is more appropriate for kindergarten-age children.
